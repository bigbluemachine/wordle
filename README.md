This is my implementation of the Wordle game, the official version of which has apparently been acquired by the New York Times. Unlike the official one, I randomly grab a word from the Scrabble word list. It *tries* to bias towards more common words, but doesn't do a great job of it. The "proper" way would involve ranking the words somehow, but I'm too lazy to figure out how they should be ranked.

In any case, at least it's replayable, right? You can play random puzzles, create a puzzle using your own seed strings, generate a link to a puzzle to share it, and so on. Have fun!
